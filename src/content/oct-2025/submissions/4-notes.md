# Editing notes for Write the Docs exercise

## Review Comments

1.  Opening section under title "Working with the History API" is not clear. A diagram illustrating interaction between the page components, and the user, would help the explanation. A simple UML sequence diagram would work well here.

2.  In this paragraph that begins with "The pushState()  …." In the third sentence, replace "… this history entry, …." with "… the session history entry, ….".  Using "this history entry" is confusing.

3.  Change "The main purpose of these APIs …." to "The main purpose of the History API…." for clarity. I was not sure to what 'these APIs' referred.

4.  A subheading like "[Single-page applications and session history](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API/Working_with_the_History_API#single-page_applications_and_session_history)" should be title case.

No further comments, the remainder of the document and its coding examples are good.
